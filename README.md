# weatherApp

This project was built using React.js and implements APIs from Google Maps and OpenWeatherMap.

The app provides weather data based on zip code, and then tracks recent searches on a map provided through the Google Maps API.

For this project, I wanted to explore React as a possible framework to use for my final project. It was important for me to try to work with implementing APIs with the framework which is why I made my app primarily center around a couple APIs. I found React to be more restrictive than I wanted for my app, and I had a difficult time working with the APIs. I'm glad I took the opportunity to work with React, but I will be using Vue for my final prjoect.

I consulted a variety of resources to create my app, but took general structures and not specific code.
